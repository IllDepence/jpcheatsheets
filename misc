- - - -

- 代える is used to signify a substitution
    先生に代わって授業を行う: Substitute for the teacher
    身代わりになる: Act as a replacement (person)
- 換わり is used when:
    you redo an action already done: 書き換え (rewrite), 言い換え (rephrase)
    you redo an action with a different object: 乗り換え (change vehicles)
    exchange something 置き換える(replace)、引き換える(exchange)
- 替える is used when you exchange (generally, with something new)
    買い替え (repurchase)、クラス替え (class change)、着替え(replace clothes).

The difference between 代わる and the rest is evident: you are generally using some substitute. It also has a lot of people-centric usage, hence the にんべん.
Now that leaves 替える and 換える. Usage 1,2 of 換える are different enough but usage 3 and 替える are similar, and have significant overlap. How do you choose the correct one?

    1. If on a PC, just use the one that comes up first. If writing by hand, and you can't afford an error, just write in hiragana. That's what the government does, apparently.
    2. Use the kanji corresponding to the 熟語 form: 置換 -> 置き換え
    3. 換える is a general replacement, 替える usually encompasses an obsolescence process. Exchanging air: 空気の入れ換え or 換気. The air does not become useless. 買い替え, the thing you bought is in use, the thing before is not. 着替え, the clothes you change into replace what you wore.
    4. seem equivalent? use 替え. That's what common literature errs on.
